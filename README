# Brancher
Doing things easy and quick. With that in mind I created Brancher, by setting up a connection with your issue tracker
you can create feature branches per issue. How cool is that?

# Latest release
The latest release (compiled PHAR) is available as a download on http://stefanius.nl/products/brancher

# Compile
If you for some reason want to compile the package by yourself, you need to get a copy of https://github.com/box-project/box2.
Once installed you can run ```php compile```. The result will be a single PHAR file.

# Globally
The software is at his best when it is installed globally on your system.

# How to use
Once you installed the package you can use it on all your repositories. To enable it you should run ```brancher lib:setup```.
